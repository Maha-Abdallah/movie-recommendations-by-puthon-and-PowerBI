# Movie Recommendation System with Python and Power BI

This repository implements a movie recommendation system using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in Python and integrates it with Power BI for visualization.

# Project Description

This project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations for users based on their past ratings or interactions. The system utilizes KNN to identify users with similar movie preferences and suggest movies they might enjoy. Additionally, the project explores the integration of Python output with Power BI for insightful data visualization.

Installation

Create a Python Environment:I'am using virtual environment manager Jupyter.
Install Dependencies: Activate virtual environment and install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt 

# Usage

Data Preparation: Ensure  movie data is in a format compatible with the code (e.g., CSV).
The data should include user IDs, movie IDs, and potentially ratings or interaction indicators.
Run Python Script: Execute python movie_recommendations.py from the command line. This script will:
Load data (replace the data path in the script if needed).
Train the KNN model (optional: uncomment the training section if you want to evaluate model performance).
Generate movie recommendations for a specific user ID (you can modify the user ID in the script).
Power BI Integration (Optional):Create a Power BI report connecting to the Python output (recommended movies), visualize the recommendations in Power BI.

# Data Considerations

The script assumes data is in a specific format (adjust as needed).
Data cleaning and preprocessing steps are not explicitly shown but might be necessary depending on your data quality.

Further Development

Explore more sophisticated recommendation algorithms (e.g., Matrix Factorization).
Implement a user interface for interactive recommendations.
Enhance the Power BI report with additional visualizations.
